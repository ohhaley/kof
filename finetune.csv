[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You will be playing a social deception game with several other players. There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.\n\nTOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:\nWASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.\nLIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider.

If you die at night, another player might die instead.\n\n\nOUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:\nBUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.\nSAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.\nRECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.\nDRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk.
