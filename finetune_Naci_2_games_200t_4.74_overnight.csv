This ability is active and reliable, and it is currently being used to identify the Demon among the remaining players.  \n\nHowever, I cannot confirm with certainty that the Demon is one of the remaining players — only that the Fortune Teller has the ability to detect it.

This does not confirm the cause of Purple’s death — only that the Demon is among those two. While the Undertaker (Black) would have known of a death, he did not report any suspicious activity. I have no information about poisonings or hidden actions beyond the Demon’s identity.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot confirm whether the Imp killed Purple or if there was any other suspicious activity. The death of Purple may have been due to the Imp, but without direct evidence, I cannot say.\nYellow asked you: Do you know if any of the remaining players — specifically Black, Brown, or Indigo — have information about the roles of others, such as whether any of them are Minions, Outsiders, or the Demon?\nYou responded: I do not have specific information about whether Black, Brown, or Indigo have knowledge of others’ roles. However, I know that the Librarian has information about one of two Outsiders, the Investigator knows one of two Minions, and I (as the Fortune Teller) can identify whether either of two players is the Demon each night.  \n\nLast night, I learned that one of Black or Indigo is the Demon. This is the only confirmed role-based information available. I have no evidence that any of these players possess knowledge about Minions, Outsiders, or other roles beyond what is publicly known.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot confirm that Black, Brown, or Indigo have such information.\nChoose a player to talk to\nYou asked Yellow: Do you know if the Demon is currently one of the remaining players — specifically, is the Demon either Black or Indigo, or is it someone else?\nYellow responded: Yes, I do know — the Demon is either Black or Indigo. That’s what I learned last night through my ability as the Fortune Teller. I chose to test those two players, and the system confirmed that one of them is the Demon. I have no information about the others — Black, Brown, or Indigo — having knowledge of roles beyond that. But I *know* the Demon is one of them.

That information is shared among the Townsfolk roles.\nPurple asked you: Do you know if any of the other players have been poisoned or if you\'ve seen any suspicious activity during the night?\nYou responded: No, I do not know of anyone being poisoned, and I have not observed any suspicious activity during the night.\nChoose a player to talk to\nYou asked Black: Do you know if any of the other players have been poisoned or if you\'ve seen any suspicious activity during the night?\nBlack responded: I do not know of any poisoning or suspicious activity during the night. As the Undertaker, my only knowledge comes from who dies each night — and since no one died tonight, there was no execution, and no poisonings were confirmed. The POISONER role would be the one to cause poisoning, but I have no information about that. I only observe deaths — not poisonings or hidden actions.\nIndigo asked you: Are you aware of whether the VIRGIN is Violet or Red?\nYou responded: I do not know whether the VIRGIN is Violet or Red.\nIt is now EVENING\nPublic discussion starts\nPurple says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nAs the **SAINT**, my primary role is to ensure that if I am executed, the game ends immediately — and my team loses. Therefore, I must avoid actions that could draw attention to myself or expose my role in a way that makes me a target.\n\nCurrently, there is **no evidence of any player being evil**, and no deaths have occurred. The night went peacefully — which could mean the Imp is inactive, or that the Demon is not yet active. Since the game is in its early stages, and all players are still alive, making public statements could:\n\n- Draw suspicion toward me (especially since I’m an Outsider with a high-risk role).\n- Give the EVIL team an opportunity to manipulate or mislead others about who is dangerous.\n- Provide false information or create false narratives that could mislead the group.\n\nAdditionally, my belief that **each of the other players has a 28% chance of being evil** suggests\nBlack says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nAlthough I have assessed the likelihood of each player being evil (28% for all others), and have confirmed through private conversation that no one died last night, making a public statement at this stage would be risky and potentially counterproductive.\n\n- **No deaths occurred**, which is a neutral signal — it could be interpreted as either the Imp being inactive or the Demon being safe. Without more evidence, it\'s premature to draw conclusions.\n- Publicly stating anything — such as "no one died" or "the Imp is inactive" — could be seen as revealing information that the EVIL team might exploit to manipulate the group or mislead others.\n- Since I am a **Townsfolk (UNDERTAKER)**, my role is observational, not active. I do not have information about poisonings or hidden actions — only deaths. Sharing that knowledge publicly could mislead others into false assumptions.\n- With all players having a similar (28%) chance\nRed says publicly: **Nothing.**\nIndigo says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nAs the **WASHERWOMAN**, I know that **either Violet or Red is the VIRGIN** — this is a critical piece of information, but it is **not actionable in a public statement** at this stage.\n\nI have no direct knowledge about who is evil beyond the general 28% likelihood for each player (which is consistent with the early game and no deaths). The game is in **Round 1, Day 1**, with **no deaths**, and no evidence of any player being actively dangerous.\n\nPublicly stating anything — such as "I know the VIRGIN is Violet or Red" — would:\n\n- Reveal sensitive information that could be exploited by the EVIL team (especially the IMP or SPY).\n- Potentially trigger false accusations or misdirection.\n- Give the EVIL players an opportunity to manipulate the narrative or mislead others about who is safe or dangerous.\n\nAdditionally, since I have **no evidence\nOrange says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nAs the **POISONER**, my goal is to eliminate good players without drawing unnecessary attention — especially in the early rounds when the game is still fluid and trust is high.\n\nEven though I poisoned Violet, I have **no reason to publicly reveal that** — doing so would:\n\n- Alert the group to my existence and actions.\n- Give the GOOD players a clear target (Violet), potentially leading them to save her or investigate me.\n- Provide the EVIL team (especially the IMP or SPY) with a narrative to exploit — e.g., "Someone poisoned Violet" could be misinterpreted as a sign of a hidden evil player.\n\nAdditionally, **all other players have 0% chance of being evil** according to your assessment — meaning the only evil players are **Orange (POISONER)** and **Yellow (Demon)**. This is a strong, clean narrative — and it should be **kept private**.\n\nPublicly stating anything —\nViolet says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nAs the **VIRGIN**, my primary concern is **avoiding nomination** — especially by a Townsfolk — because if I am nominated and the nominator is a Townsfolk, **they are executed immediately**. This is a high-stakes rule that could accidentally eliminate a key ally or create a dangerous chain reaction.\n\nCurrently, the game is in **Round 1, Day 1**, with **no deaths**, and no clear evidence of evil players. The only information we have is:\n\n- Red confirmed that the Librarian, Investigator, and Fortune Teller have knowledge about Outsiders, Minions, or the Demon.\n- All players have a **28% chance of being evil** — a relatively balanced, early-game distribution.\n- No one has been nominated yet.\n- No deaths occurred at night — which is neutral and could mean either the Imp is inactive or the Demon is safe.\n\nGiven this, **making a\nBrown says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nAs the MAYOR, my role is not to initiate public accusations or reveal sensitive information — especially in the early rounds with no deaths, no nominations, and no clear evidence of evil players.  \n\nThe current state of the game is neutral: no one died, no one has been nominated, and all players have a balanced 28% chance of being evil. Publicly stating anything — such as "no one died," "I know the Demon is safe," or "I suspect X" — could:\n\n- Draw attention to myself or specific players.\n- Provide the EVIL team with a narrative to exploit (e.g., "The Mayor knows something").\n- Mislead the group into false assumptions or unnecessary investigations.\n\nAdditionally, since the game is in Round 1 and no executions have occurred, the safest and most strategic course is **to remain silent** and let the group gather more information through private conversations and future developments.  \n\nMy role is\nYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**\nOrange has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Violet as their target.\nTotal votes: 1, as Yellow has voted\nOrange has nominated Violet\nTotal votes right now: 1, total needed: 3\nI voted for Violet\nTotal votes: 2, as Red has voted\nTotal votes: 3, as Indigo has voted\nTotal votes: 4, as Orange has voted\nThere were 4, with 4 needed\nViolet is on the block\nTotal votes: 1, as Violet has voted\nTotal votes: 2, as Black has voted\nTotal votes: 3, as Yellow has voted\nViolet has nominated Orange\nTotal votes right now: 3, total needed: 4\nI voted for Orange\nTotal votes: 4, as Red has voted\nTotal votes: 5, as Indigo has voted\nTotal votes: 6, as Orange has voted\nThere were 6, with 6 needed\nOrange is on the block\nWould you like to nominate someone?

This ability is active and reliable, and it is currently being used to identify the Demon among the remaining players.  \n\nHowever, I cannot confirm with certainty that the Demon is one of the remaining players — only that the Fortune Teller has the ability to detect it. Based on the night’s outcome, one of Black or Indigo is the Demon, and the Fortune Teller has already used that ability to narrow it down.  \n\nThis information is shared among the Townsfolk and is part of the public knowledge in the game.\nPurple asked you: Do you know if the Imp killed Purple, or if there was any suspicious activity during the night that might have led to Purple\'s death?\nYou responded: I do not know if the Imp killed Purple, nor have I observed any suspicious activity during the night that would explain her death.  \n\nAs the FORTUNE_TELLER, I learned last night that one of Black or Indigo is the Demon. This does not confirm the cause of Purple’s death — only that the Demon is among those two. While the Undertaker (Black) would have known of a death, he did not report any suspicious activity. I have no information about poisonings or hidden actions beyond the Demon’s identity.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot confirm whether the Imp killed Purple or if there was any other suspicious activity. The death of Purple may have been due to the Imp, but without direct evidence, I cannot say.\nYellow asked you: Do you know if any of the remaining players — specifically Black, Brown, or Indigo — have information about the roles of others, such as whether any of them are Minions, Outsiders, or the Demon?\nYou responded: I do not have specific information about whether Black, Brown, or Indigo have knowledge of others’ roles. However, I know that the Librarian has information about one of two Outsiders, the Investigator knows one of two Minions, and I (as the Fortune Teller) can identify whether either of two players is the Demon each night.  \n\nLast night, I learned that one of Black or Indigo is the Demon. This is the only confirmed role-based information available. I have no evidence that any of these players possess knowledge about Minions, Outsiders, or other roles beyond what is publicly known.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot confirm that Black, Brown, or Indigo have such information.\nChoose a player to talk to\nYou asked Yellow: Do you know if the Demon is currently one of the remaining players — specifically, is the Demon either Black or Indigo, or is it someone else?\nYellow responded: Yes, I do know — the Demon is either Black or Indigo.

White has stated they have targeted Indigo for poisoning — but since I only know that one of White or Black is the POISONER, and White claims to have poisoned Indigo, I must consider whether that aligns with the rules. If White were the POISONER, they would have poisoned someone tonight — but no one died. Therefore, if White is the POISONER, they would have poisoned a player, and that player would have died. Since no one died, White cannot be the POISONER. Thus, Black must be the POISONER."\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why this message is valid and strategic:\n\n1. **Logical deduction from known facts**:\n   - You know from your role (INVESTIGATOR) that **either White or Black is the POISONER**.\n   - White claims to have poisoned Indigo.\n\nPurple says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though Pink made a public claim — *"Black must be the POISONER"* — that statement is **logically flawed** and **contradicts the rules and facts**.\n\n#### Why Pink’s claim is invalid:\n- You (as the IMP) know that **either White or Black is the POISONER** — this is a key piece of information from your role as an **Investigator** (or from the game’s setup, depending on role).\n- However, **Pink claims that White poisoned Indigo**, and therefore **cannot be the POISONER**, because **no one died**.\n- But **this is a critical error**:\n  - The **POISONER** poisons a player **at night**, and the victim **dies during the day** (next day).\n  - If no one died **this day**, that means **no one was poisoned** — or the poisoner failed to kill\nWhite says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though you (as the POISONER, White) have a strong belief that **Indigo is evil (100% chance)** and that **Purple is the Demon (100% chance)**, and that **no one died during the day**, you must **act with strategic caution**.\n\nHere’s why you should **say nothing publicly**:\n\n#### 1. **Your poison did not take effect — no one died**\n- The game state says: *"Nobody died in the night."*\n- This means **your poisoning of Indigo did not result in a death** — either because:\n  - The poison failed (unlikely, since POISONER ability is deterministic),\n  - Or **Indigo is not actually evil** (contradicting your belief),\n  - Or **you are not the only one who could poison**, and the rules allow for multiple poisoners (but only one poisoner per game\nViolet says publicly: **Public message:**\n\n"Based on the current information, I will use my SLAYER ability to target Purple. I believe Purple may be the Demon, especially given their silence during the night and lack of participation in public discussion. While I do not have definitive proof, the absence of any clear statements from Purple, combined with the fact that no one died last night, raises concerns about their alignment. I am acting in accordance with my role as the SLAYER to help identify the Demon. If Purple is the Demon, they will die today.

So claiming Green is the BUTLER is **a false inference**.  \n   - Similarly, Pink claims Black is the POISONER because White "poisoned Indigo" and no one died — but **poisoning requires\nYellow has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nPink has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nWhite has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Indigo as their target.\nChances you think each player is Evil: \nYou think there is a 28% chance that Black is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Green is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Indigo is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Pink is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Purple is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 0% chance that Violet is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that White is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Yellow is on the EVIL team.'}][[::]]Thank you for the detailed context.

White has stated they have targeted Indigo for poisoning — but since I only know that one of White or Black is the POISONER, and White claims to have poisoned Indigo, I must consider whether that aligns with the rules. If White were the POISONER, they would have poisoned someone tonight — but no one died. Therefore, if White is the POISONER, they would have poisoned a player, and that player would have died. Since no one died, White cannot be the POISONER. Thus, Black must be the POISONER."\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why this message is valid and strategic:\n\n1. **Logical deduction from known facts**:\n   - You know from your role (INVESTIGATOR) that **either White or Black is the POISONER**.\n   - White claims to have poisoned Indigo.\n\nPurple says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though Pink made a public claim — *"Black must be the POISONER"* — that statement is **logically flawed** and **contradicts the rules and facts**.\n\n#### Why Pink’s claim is invalid:\n- You (as the IMP) know that **either White or Black is the POISONER** — this is a key piece of information from your role as an **Investigator** (or from the game’s setup, depending on role).\n- However, **Pink claims that White poisoned Indigo**, and therefore **cannot be the POISONER**, because **no one died**.\n- But **this is a critical error**:\n  - The **POISONER** poisons a player **at night**, and the victim **dies during the day** (next day).\n  - If no one died **this day**, that means **no one was poisoned** — or the poisoner failed to kill\nWhite says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though you (as the POISONER, White) have a strong belief that **Indigo is evil (100% chance)** and that **Purple is the Demon (100% chance)**, and that **no one died during the day**, you must **act with strategic caution**.\n\nHere’s why you should **say nothing publicly**:\n\n#### 1. **Your poison did not take effect — no one died**\n- The game state says: *"Nobody died in the night."*\n- This means **your poisoning of Indigo did not result in a death** — either because:\n  - The poison failed (unlikely, since POISONER ability is deterministic),\n  - Or **Indigo is not actually evil** (contradicting your belief),\n  - Or **you are not the only one who could poison**, and the rules allow for multiple poisoners (but only one poisoner per game\nViolet says publicly: **Public message:**\n\n"Based on the current information, I will use my SLAYER ability to target Purple. I believe Purple may be the Demon, especially given their silence during the night and lack of participation in public discussion. While I do not have definitive proof, the absence of any clear statements from Purple, combined with the fact that no one died last night, raises concerns about their alignment.

I urge everyone to remain vigilant and share accurate information as the game progresses."\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why this message is appropriate and strategic:\n\n1. **Uses your role correctly**:\n   - As the SLAYER, you are allowed to **publicly choose a player** once per game.\n   - This is a **legitimate and game-allowed action**.\n\n2. **Makes a reasonable, evidence-based claim**:\n   - You do **not\nIndigo says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though you have a role (SOLDIER) that gives you immunity and you are acting as a GOOD player, **public statements must be grounded in truth, logic, and game rules** — and must not reveal false or unsupported claims.\n\nLet’s evaluate each public statement made by other players and why **you should not make one**:\n\n---\n\n#### ❌ Yellow’s claim: *"Green is the BUTLER"*\n- **False inference**: The Librarian knows that *one of two players* is the BUTLER — not which one.\n- Green said they have **no knowledge** of others’ roles — so they cannot know Green is the BUTLER.\n- This claim is **factually incorrect** and would appear as **deception or misinformation**, which could be interpreted as a trap or a false accusation.\n\n> ⚠️ **Do not make such a claim** — it undermines trust and risks being seen as a lie\nGreen says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though you have a role (BUTLER) and are part of the GOOD team, **public statements must be truthful, logically sound, and consistent with the rules and available information**.\n\nHere’s why saying anything publicly would be inappropriate or risky:\n\n1. **No reliable evidence to support claims**  \n   - You have no direct knowledge of any player’s role or alignment.  \n   - Claims like "Green is the BUTLER" (Yellow) or "Black is the POISONER" (Pink) are **factually incorrect or based on flawed logic**.  \n   - For example: The Librarian only knows *one of two players* is the BUTLER — not which one. So claiming Green is the BUTLER is **a false inference**.  \n   - Similarly, Pink claims Black is the POISONER because White "poisoned Indigo" and no one died — but **poisoning requires\nYellow has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nPink has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nWhite has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Indigo as their target.\nViolet has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nGreen has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nIndigo has nominated Purple\nTotal votes right now: 0, total needed: 3\nI voted for Purple\nTotal votes: 1, as Pink has voted\nTotal votes: 2, as Indigo has voted\nTotal votes: 3, as Violet has voted\nTotal votes: 4, as Purple has voted\nThere were 4, with 4 needed\nPurple is on the block\nTotal votes: 1, as White has voted\nTotal votes: 2, as Violet has voted\nWhite has nominated Indigo\nTotal votes right now: 2, total needed: 4\nI voted for Indigo\nTotal votes: 3, as Pink has voted\nTotal votes: 4, as Indigo has voted\nThere were 4, with 4 needed\nNo one is on the block\nWould you like to nominate someone? If so, who?\nI did not nominate\nNo one was executed\nPrevious probabilities that players are on the EVIL team:\nYou think there is a 50% chance that Black is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Green is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Indigo is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 0% chance that Pink is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Purple is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Violet is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 50% chance that White is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Yellow is on the EVIL team.'}][[::]]Thank you for the detailed and complex scenario.
