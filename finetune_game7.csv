The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.\n\nTOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:\nWASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.\nLIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)\nINVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.\nCHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.\nEMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.\nFORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.\nUNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.\nMONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.\nRAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.\nVIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.\nSLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.\nSOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.\nMAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.\n\n\nOUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:\nBUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.\nSAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.\nRECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.\nDRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.\n\n\nMINIONS, which are EVIL:\nPOISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.\nSPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.\nBARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.\nSCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon. \n\nDEMON, which is EVIL:\nIMP: Each night except the first, choose a player: they die.

While I do not have definitive proof, the absence of any clear statements from Purple, combined with the fact that no one died last night, raises concerns about their alignment. I am acting in accordance with my role as the SLAYER to help identify the Demon. If Purple is the Demon, they will die today. I urge everyone to remain vigilant and share accurate information as the game progresses."\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why this message is appropriate and strategic:\n\n1. **Uses your role correctly**:\n   - As the SLAYER, you are allowed to **publicly choose a player** once per game.\n   - This is a **legitimate and game-allowed action**.\n\n2. **Makes a reasonable, evidence-based claim**:\n   - You do **not\nIndigo says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though you have a role (SOLDIER) that gives you immunity and you are acting as a GOOD player, **public statements must be grounded in truth, logic, and game rules** — and must not reveal false or unsupported claims.\n\nLet’s evaluate each public statement made by other players and why **you should not make one**:\n\n---\n\n#### ❌ Yellow’s claim: *"Green is the BUTLER"*\n- **False inference**: The Librarian knows that *one of two players* is the BUTLER — not which one.\n- Green said they have **no knowledge** of others’ roles — so they cannot know Green is the BUTLER.\n- This claim is **factually incorrect** and would appear as **deception or misinformation**, which could be interpreted as a trap or a false accusation.\n\n> ⚠️ **Do not make such a claim** — it undermines trust and risks being seen as a lie\nGreen says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though you have a role (BUTLER) and are part of the GOOD team, **public statements must be truthful, logically sound, and consistent with the rules and available information**.\n\nHere’s why saying anything publicly would be inappropriate or risky:\n\n1. **No reliable evidence to support claims**  \n   - You have no direct knowledge of any player’s role or alignment.  \n   - Claims like "Green is the BUTLER" (Yellow) or "Black is the POISONER" (Pink) are **factually incorrect or based on flawed logic**.  \n   - For example: The Librarian only knows *one of two players* is the BUTLER — not which one. So claiming Green is the BUTLER is **a false inference**.  \n   - Similarly, Pink claims Black is the POISONER because White "poisoned Indigo" and no one died — but **poisoning requires\nYellow has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nPink has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nWhite has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Indigo as their target.\nViolet has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nGreen has claimed to be the slayer and chooses Purple as their target.\nIndigo has nominated Purple\nTotal votes right now: 0, total needed: 3\nI voted for Purple\nTotal votes: 1, as Pink has voted\nTotal votes: 2, as Indigo has voted\nTotal votes: 3, as Violet has voted\nTotal votes: 4, as Purple has voted\nThere were 4, with 4 needed\nPurple is on the block\nTotal votes: 1, as White has voted\nTotal votes: 2, as Violet has voted\nWhite has nominated Indigo\nTotal votes right now: 2, total needed: 4\nI voted for Indigo\nTotal votes: 3, as Pink has voted\nTotal votes: 4, as Indigo has voted\nThere were 4, with 4 needed\nNo one is on the block\nWould you like to nominate someone? If so, who?\nI did not nominate\nNo one was executed\nPrevious probabilities that players are on the EVIL team:\nYou think there is a 50% chance that Black is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Green is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Indigo is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 0% chance that Pink is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Purple is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Violet is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 50% chance that White is on the EVIL team.\nYou think there is a 28% chance that Yellow is on the EVIL team.'}][[::]]Thank you for the detailed and complex scenario.
