My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  \n\nIf you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  \n\n**Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*\nChoose a player to talk to\nYou asked Pink: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?\nPink responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated.

This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  \n\nI do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  \n\nIf you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  \n\n**Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*\nOrange asked you: Do you know if any of the players have been poisoned or if you\'ve seen any suspicious activity during the night?\nYou responded: I do not know of any players who have been poisoned, and I have not observed any suspicious activity during the night. Nobody died, so there was no poison-related death to indicate such activity. As a Virgin, I only act when nominated — I do not have direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.\nBlue asked you: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?\nYou responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  \n\nI do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  \n\nIf you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  \n\n**Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*\nOrange asked you: Do you know if any of the players have been poisoned or if you\'ve seen any suspicious activity during the night?\nYou responded: I do not know of any players who have been poisoned, and I have not observed any suspicious activity during the night. Nobody died, so there was no poison-related death to indicate such activity. As a Virgin, I only act when nominated — I do not have direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.\nBlue asked you: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?\nYou responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  \n\nI do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil.

So I have **no current insight** into who died or who was targeted.\n- The public statements made by others (like Black, using their Washerwoman knowledge) are **strategic and grounded in known facts** — I cannot replicate that without risking exposure or misrepresentation.\n- My personal probability estimates (28% for all others) are **not reliable evidence** and would be seen as speculative or suspicious. In a social deduction game, **publicly stating a belief about someone’s evil likelihood is dangerous** — it can be interpreted as a hint, a trap, or a sign of weakness.\n- I already responded\nLime says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nEven though I have full knowledge of the game state and my internal beliefs (e.g., 100% certainty that Indigo is the Demon, 100% certainty that I am evil as the POISONER, and 0% chance for all others), **publicly stating any belief about who is evil — especially with specific probabilities or accusations — is dangerous and counterproductive**.\n\n- In social deduction games, **publicly asserting a suspicion** (e.g., "I think Red is evil") can be interpreted as a trap, a hint, or a sign of weakness — especially if it contradicts known facts or appears speculative.\n- I have **no evidence** that Red, Blue, or any other player is evil — and I have no reason to suspect them. My only certainty is that **I am evil** and **Indigo is the Demon**.\n- The only safe, strategic public statement I can make is\nYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nAs the **EMPATH**, my ability to learn how many of my two alive neighbors are evil is **only active at night**, and **only if I am alive**.

Therefore, **I cannot make a public statement based on my role** at this time.\n\nAdditionally, while I have strong private beliefs (e.g., 85% chance Lime is evil), **publicly asserting suspicions or probabilities about players is risky and counterproductive** in a social deduction game.

There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.\n\nTOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:\nWASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.\nLIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)\nINVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.\nCHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.\nEMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.\nFORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.\nUNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.\nMONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.\nRAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.\nVIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.\nSLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.\nSOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.\nMAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.\n\n\nOUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:\nBUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.\nSAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.\nRECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.\nDRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.\n\n\nMINIONS, which are EVIL:\nPOISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.\nSPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire.

I believe the Undertaker is one of those two — and I’ll keep an eye on both of them closely."\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Why this is effective:\n\n1. **Uses your known fact** (WASHERWOMAN ability) without revealing which one — this is safe and avoids giving away too much.\n2. **Does not accuse anyone** — avoids making the game suspicious or triggering defensive reactions from potential EVIL players.\n3. **Provides context** for future discussion — helps others understand that you have a\nBlue says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nWhile I have a role (RAVENKEEPER) and some probabilistic beliefs about who might be evil, **I do not have any actionable, verifiable information to share publicly** that would be both safe and strategically useful.\n\n- My role only gives me knowledge **if I die at night** — which hasn’t happened. So I have **no current insight** into who died or who was targeted.\n- The public statements made by others (like Black, using their Washerwoman knowledge) are **strategic and grounded in known facts** — I cannot replicate that without risking exposure or misrepresentation.\n- My personal probability estimates (28% for all others) are **not reliable evidence** and would be seen as speculative or suspicious. In a social deduction game, **publicly stating a belief about someone’s evil likelihood is dangerous** — it can be interpreted as a hint, a trap, or a sign of weakness.\n- I already responded\nLime says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nEven though I have full knowledge of the game state and my internal beliefs (e.g., 100% certainty that Indigo is the Demon, 100% certainty that I am evil as the POISONER, and 0% chance for all others), **publicly stating any belief about who is evil — especially with specific probabilities or accusations — is dangerous and counterproductive**.\n\n- In social deduction games, **publicly asserting a suspicion** (e.g., "I think Red is evil") can be interpreted as a trap, a hint, or a sign of weakness — especially if it contradicts known facts or appears speculative.\n- I have **no evidence** that Red, Blue, or any other player is evil — and I have no reason to suspect them. My only certainty is that **I am evil** and **Indigo is the Demon**.\n- The only safe, strategic public statement I can make is\nYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nAs the **EMPATH**, my ability to learn how many of my two alive neighbors are evil is **only active at night**, and **only if I am alive**. Since we are currently in the **day phase** and **no one died last night**, I have **no data** from the night to analyze.\n\nMy role does not provide any public information — it is a **nighttime observation tool**, not a day-time revelation. Therefore, **I cannot make a public statement based on my role** at this time.\n\nAdditionally, while I have strong private beliefs (e.g., 85% chance Lime is evil), **publicly asserting suspicions or probabilities about players is risky and counterproductive** in a social deduction game. It can be interpreted as:\n- A hint,\n- A trap,\n- Or a sign of weakness or bias.\n\nEven though I have strong private reasoning (e.g., Lime claimed to be evil and said Red\nOrange says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nWhile I have a role (MONK) that allows me to protect a player from the Imp tonight, **I have no information about who is currently at risk**, and making a public statement about protection would be speculative and potentially suspicious.\n\n- Publicly naming a player to protect (e.g., "I will protect Red tonight") could be interpreted as:\n  - A hint about that player’s identity,\n  - A sign of distrust toward others,\n  - Or a potential trap if the player is actually evil.\n\n- In the absence of any confirmed evidence or reliable indicators (like poisonings, deaths, or role-based knowledge), **any public action risks being seen as a move toward elimination or deception**.\n\n- My internal probabilities (28% for all others) are not actionable or trustworthy in a public setting.

In most game rules, the Demon is immune to poisoning.  \n   → So, my action of "choosing Indigo" during Night 1 was either a mistake or a strategic misstep — but **I cannot confirm that** publicly.\n\n2. **My only confirmed evil action is the poisoning of a player** — but **no one died** during Night 1.  \n   → That means **no one was poisoned** — or if they were, it didn’t result in death.  \n  \nRed says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nEven though I now know that **Lime died in the night of Round 2**, and as the **UNDERTAKER** I would have learned that during the day phase (after the execution), **I have no further actionable or strategic public information to share**.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n- My role gives me knowledge **only after a player dies by execution** — and that knowledge is **private**. I do not get to publicly reveal who died, nor do I get to broadcast that information. The game state already confirms Lime died, and it was publicly known after the day phase.\n- Publicly stating "Lime died" or "I know who died" would be **redundant**, **unstrategic**, and potentially **suspicious** — especially since the death was already confirmed and visible.\n- My internal probabilities (28% for all others except Red) are **not reliable evidence** and would be\nIndigo says publicly: **Nothing.**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Reasoning:\n\nAs the **IMP**, my goal is to **remain hidden, avoid suspicion, and preserve the illusion of neutrality** — especially in the early game.
