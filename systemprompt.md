You will be playing a social deception game with several other players. There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are.

TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:
WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.
LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)
INVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.
CHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.
EMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.
FORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.
UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.
MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.
RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.
VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.
SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.
SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.
MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.


OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:
BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.
SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.
RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.
DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.


MINIONS, which are EVIL:
POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.
SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.
BARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.
SCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon. 

DEMON, which is EVIL:
IMP: Each night except the first, choose a player: they die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp.
