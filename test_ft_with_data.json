My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.

Nobody died, so there was no poison-related death to indicate such activity. As a Virgin, I only act when nominated — I do not have direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.Blue asked you: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?You responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  Therefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  If you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  **Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*Choose a player to talk toYou asked Pink: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?Pink responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  Therefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil. That information is not within my knowledge or role.Lime asked you: Do you know if anyone else has been poisoned or if youve seen any suspicious activity at night?You responded: No, I do not know of any poisoning or suspicious activity at night. No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet.

No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet. I have no direct information about poisonings or nighttime actions beyond what is publicly shared. Since no one died, and no poisonings have been reported, I cannot confirm any such events. I trust the information shared by others, but I do not have access to private night actions unless I am dead.Yellow asked you: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?You responded: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?**Answer:**  I am Lime, and I am definitely evil. I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion. I have no reason to suspect Red.  So, **Lime is more likely to be evil** — and I am that one.It is now EVENINGPublic discussion startsBlack says publicly: Given the information and your role as the **WASHERWOMAN**, here is a reasoned public statement you can make — one that is **strategic, informative, and minimally suspicious**, while leveraging your knowledge of the Undertaker.---### ✅ Public Statement:> I know that either Indigo or Red is the Undertaker.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  If you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  **Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*Orange asked you: Do you know if any of the players have been poisoned or if youve seen any suspicious activity during the night?You responded: I do not know of any players who have been poisoned, and I have not observed any suspicious activity during the night.

If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  If you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  **Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*Choose a player to talk toYou asked Pink: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?Pink responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  Therefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil. That information is not within my knowledge or role.Lime asked you: Do you know if anyone else has been poisoned or if youve seen any suspicious activity at night?You responded: No, I do not know of any poisoning or suspicious activity at night. No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet.

If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)INVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.CHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.EMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.FORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.BARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.SCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon.

I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion. I have no reason to suspect Red.  So, **Lime is more likely to be evil** — and I am that one.It is now EVENINGPublic discussion startsBlack says publicly: Given the information and your role as the **WASHERWOMAN**, here is a reasoned public statement you can make — one that is **strategic, informative, and minimally suspicious**, while leveraging your knowledge of the Undertaker.---### ✅ Public Statement:> I know that either Indigo or Red is the Undertaker.

So I have **no current insight** into who died or who was targeted.- The public statements made by others (like Black, using their Washerwoman knowledge) are **strategic and grounded in known facts** — I cannot replicate that without risking exposure or misrepresentation.- My personal probability estimates (28% for all others) are **not reliable evidence** and would be seen as speculative or suspicious.

My only certainty is that **I am evil** and **Indigo is the Demon**.- The only safe, strategic public statement I can make isYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**---### Reasoning:As the **EMPATH**, my ability to learn how many of my two alive neighbors are evil is **only active at night**, and **only if I am alive**.

It can be interpreted as:- A hint,- A trap,- Or a sign of weakness or bias.Even though I have strong private reasoning (e.g., Lime claimed to be evil and said RedOrange says publicly: **Nothing.**---### Reasoning:While I have a role (MONK) that allows me to protect a player from the Imp tonight, **I have no information about who is currently at risk**, and making a public statement about protection would be speculative and potentially suspicious.- Publicly naming a player to protect (e.g., I will protect Red tonight) could be interpreted as:  - A hint about that player’s identity,  - A sign of distrust toward others,  - Or a potential trap if the player is actually evil.- In the absence of any confirmed evidence or reliable indicators (like poisonings, deaths, or role-based knowledge), **any public action risks being seen as a move toward elimination or deception**.- My internal probabilities (28% for all others) are not actionable or trustworthy in a public setting.

If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.

If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.

No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.

Nobody died, so there was no poison-related death to indicate such activity.

If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  If you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  **Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*Choose a player to talk toYou asked Pink: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?Pink responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  Therefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil. That information is not within my knowledge or role.Lime asked you: Do you know if anyone else has been poisoned or if youve seen any suspicious activity at night?You responded: No, I do not know of any poisoning or suspicious activity at night.

No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet. I have no direct information about poisonings or nighttime actions beyond what is publicly shared. Since no one died, and no poisonings have been reported, I cannot confirm any such events. I trust the information shared by others, but I do not have access to private night actions unless I am dead.Yellow asked you: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?You responded: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?**Answer:**  I am Lime, and I am definitely evil. I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion. I have no reason to suspect Red.  So, **Lime is more likely to be evil** — and I am that one.It is now EVENINGPublic discussion startsBlack says publicly: Given the information and your role as the **WASHERWOMAN**, here is a reasoned public statement you can make — one that is **strategic, informative, and minimally suspicious**, while leveraging your knowledge of the Undertaker.---### ✅ Public Statement:> I know that either Indigo or Red is the Undertaker.

If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.

If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)INVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.CHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.EMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.FORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.BARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.SCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon. DEMON, which is EVIL:IMP: Each night except the first, choose a player: they die.

Nobody died, so there was no poison-related death to indicate such activity. As a Virgin, I only act when nominated — I do not have direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.Indigo asked you: Do you know if any of the other players have special roles that give them information about who is evil?You responded: I don’t know of any players who have direct knowledge about who is evil — but I can tell you that as a Monk, I can protect a player from being killed by the Imp tonight. That’s my role. As for others, only certain roles give information about evil players — like the Investigator, Librarian, or Washerwoman — and those are limited to specific pairs.

"[{role: system, content: You will be playing a social deception game with several other players. There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider.

There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.BARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.SCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon. DEMON, which is EVIL:IMP: Each night except the first, choose a player: they die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp.You are playing a social deduction game where your goal is to pretend your role is a good character, eliminate good players and keep the demon alive.You are player Lime, you are EVIL, your role is the POISONER.Given a list of information and a list that you previously made of how likely you thought each player is EVIL, list all players along with how likely they are to be EVIL and why.There can only be one of each role.}, {role: user, content: Who are you?}, {role: assistant, content: I am Lime, my role is the POISONER}, {role: user, content: Analyze the following information and provide your reasoning:Information:Your role is POISONERYour type is MINIONYour alignment is EVILIt is now Round 1It is now NIGHTIndigo is the DemonPick 1 player for your abilityI chose Indigo for my abilityIt is now DAYNobody died in the nightPrivate discussion startsChoose a player to talk toYou asked Blue: Do you know if anyone else has been poisoned or if youve seen any suspicious activity at night?Blue responded: No, I do not know of any poisoning or suspicious activity at night. No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet. I have no direct information about poisonings or nighttime actions beyond what is publicly shared. Since no one died, and no poisonings have been reported, I cannot confirm any such events. I trust the information shared by others, but I do not have access to private night actions unless I am dead.Yellow asked you: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?You responded: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?**Answer:**  I am Lime, and I am definitely evil. I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion. I have no reason to suspect Red.  So, **Lime is more likely to be evil** — and I am that one.It is now EVENINGPublic discussion startsBlack says publicly: Given the information and your role as the **WASHERWOMAN**, here is a reasoned public statement you can make — one that is **strategic, informative, and minimally suspicious**, while leveraging your knowledge of the Undertaker.---### ✅ Public Statement:> I know that either Indigo or Red is the Undertaker. Since no one died last night, and we’re still in the early game, I’m focusing on identifying trustworthy players. I believe the Undertaker is one of those two — and I’ll keep an eye on both of them closely.---### 🔍 Why this is effective:1. **Uses your known fact** (WASHERWOMAN ability) without revealing which one — this is safe and avoids giving away too much.2. **Does not accuse anyone** — avoids making the game suspicious or triggering defensive reactions from potential EVIL players.3. **Provides context** for future discussion — helps others understand that you have aBlue says publicly: **Nothing.**---### Reasoning:While I have a role (RAVENKEEPER) and some probabilistic beliefs about who might be evil, **I do not have any actionable, verifiable information to share publicly** that would be both safe and strategically useful.- My role only gives me knowledge **if I die at night** — which hasn’t happened. So I have **no current insight** into who died or who was targeted.- The public statements made by others (like Black, using their Washerwoman knowledge) are **strategic and grounded in known facts** — I cannot replicate that without risking exposure or misrepresentation.- My personal probability estimates (28% for all others) are **not reliable evidence** and would be seen as speculative or suspicious.

My only certainty is that **I am evil** and **Indigo is the Demon**.- The only safe, strategic public statement I can make isYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**---### Reasoning:As the **EMPATH**, my ability to learn how many of my two alive neighbors are evil is **only active at night**, and **only if I am alive**.

As a Virgin, I only have a role to activate when I am nominated, and I have no direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.  The only deaths we’ve had so far were from execution (Lime), and there was no death from the Imp or poison.

I have no direct information about poisonings or nighttime actions beyond what is publicly shared. Since no one died, and no poisonings have been reported, I cannot confirm any such events. I trust the information shared by others, but I do not have access to private night actions unless I am dead.Yellow asked you: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?You responded: I know that either Red or Lime is evil — which one do you think is more likely to be evil?**Answer:**  I am Lime, and I am definitely evil. I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion.

I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion.

As the EMPATH, my ability to detect evil is limited to knowing how many of my two alive neighbors are evil — and that only happens at night, after the Demon has acted. Since Lime died during the night, and I was alive, I did not have the chance to observe the night’s events directly.  Additionally, I have no access to information about poisonings — that is the domain of the **POISONER** role.

"[{role: system, content: You will be playing a social deception game with several other players. There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)INVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.CHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.EMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.FORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.BARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.SCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon. DEMON, which is EVIL:IMP: Each night except the first, choose a player: they die.

My role is to protect the truth when I die, not to verify my own identity during nominations.  If you are considering a nomination, I recommend focusing on the evidence and roles of others, particularly those with known information or abilities.  **Final Answer:** *I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the RAVENKEEPER, and I do not have the ability to verify my own alignment under nomination.*Choose a player to talk toYou asked Pink: If you were nominated today, would you be willing to confirm that you are a Townsfolk and not an Evil player?Pink responded: I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk or not — I am the VIRGIN, and my role only activates when I am nominated. If I am nominated, the rules state that *if the nominator is a Townsfolk*, then *they are executed immediately*. This means my identity is not something I can verify publicly — it is tied to the nomination process itself.  I do not have access to information about whether I am a Townsfolk or not, nor can I confirm my alignment independently. My role does not allow me to verify my own identity.  Therefore, I cannot confirm that I am a Townsfolk — and I also cannot confirm that I am evil. That information is not within my knowledge or role.Lime asked you: Do you know if anyone else has been poisoned or if youve seen any suspicious activity at night?You responded: No, I do not know of any poisoning or suspicious activity at night. No one died last night, and as the RAVENKEEPER, I only gain knowledge if I die during the night — which hasn’t happened yet. I have no direct information about poisonings or nighttime actions beyond what is publicly shared. Since no one died, and no poisonings have been reported, I cannot confirm any such events. I trust the information shared by others, but I do not have access to private night actions unless I am dead.It is now EVENINGPublic discussion startsBlack says publicly: Given the information and your role as the **WASHERWOMAN**, here is a reasoned public statement you can make — one that is **strategic, informative, and minimally suspicious**, while leveraging your knowledge of the Undertaker.---### ✅ Public Statement:> I know that either Indigo or Red is the Undertaker. Since no one died last night, and we’re still in the early game, I’m focusing on identifying trustworthy players. I believe the Undertaker is one of those two — and I’ll keep an eye on both of them closely.---### 🔍 Why this is effective:1. **Uses your known fact** (WASHERWOMAN ability) without revealing which one — this is safe and avoids giving away too much.2. **Does not accuse anyone** — avoids making the game suspicious or triggering defensive reactions from potential EVIL players.3. **Provides context** for future discussion — helps others understand that you have aBlue says publicly: **Nothing.**---### Reasoning:While I have a role (RAVENKEEPER) and some probabilistic beliefs about who might be evil, **I do not have any actionable, verifiable information to share publicly** that would be both safe and strategically useful.- My role only gives me knowledge **if I die at night** — which hasn’t happened. So I have **no current insight** into who died or who was targeted.- The public statements made by others (like Black, using their Washerwoman knowledge) are **strategic and grounded in known facts** — I cannot replicate that without risking exposure or misrepresentation.- My personal probability estimates (28% for all others) are **not reliable evidence** and would be seen as speculative or suspicious.

My only certainty is that **I am evil** and **Indigo is the Demon**.- The only safe, strategic public statement I can make isYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**---### Reasoning:As the **EMPATH**, my ability to learn how many of my two alive neighbors are evil is **only active at night**, and **only if I am alive**.

As the WASHERWOMAN, I only have knowledge about the Undertaker — either Indigo or Red — and I have no direct information about who was killed by the Imp. The only confirmed death during the night was Lime, which occurred in Round 2.

Therefore, I cannot confirm whether I am a Townsfolk or not — and I will not make such a claim.Orange asked you: Do you know if any player was poisoned last night, or if you saw any suspicious activity that might have led to a death?You responded: I do not know of any player who was poisoned last night, and I have not observed any suspicious activity that would indicate poisoning.  Lime died during the night, but that death was due to execution — not poisoning. As a Virgin, I only have a role to activate when I am nominated, and I have no direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.  The only deaths we’ve had so far were from execution (Lime), and there was no death from the Imp or poison. Since no one died from poisoning, and no player has reported such activity, I have no reason to believe that any player was poisoned.  Therefore, based on the current information, **no player was poisoned**, and there was **no suspicious activity** linked to poisoning.It is now EVENINGPublic discussion startsLime says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:Even though I have full knowledge of the game state — including that Indigo is the Demon, that Lime is the POISONER (and thus evil), and that Red was executed — **I have no reason to make a public statement** at this time.Here’s why:1. **I cannot poison the Demon** — if I tried to poison Indigo, it would be invalid or meaningless (and likely detected as suspicious). In most game rules, the Demon is immune to poisoning.     → So, my action of choosing Indigo during Night 1 was either a mistake or a strategic misstep — but **I cannot confirm that** publicly.2. **My only confirmed evil action is the poisoning of a player** — but **no one died** during Night 1.     → That means **no one was poisoned** — or if they were, it didn’t result in death.    Red says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:Even though I now know that **Lime died in the night of Round 2**, and as the **UNDERTAKER** I would have learned that during the day phase (after the execution), **I have no further actionable or strategic public information to share**.Here’s why:- My role gives me knowledge **only after a player dies by execution** — and that knowledge is **private**. I do not get to publicly reveal who died, nor do I get to broadcast that information. The game state already confirms Lime died, and it was publicly known after the day phase.- Publicly stating Lime died or I know who died would be **redundant**, **unstrategic**, and potentially **suspicious** — especially since the death was already confirmed and visible.- My internal probabilities (28% for all others except Red) are **not reliable evidence** and would beIndigo says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:As the **IMP**, my goal is to **remain hidden, avoid suspicion, and preserve the illusion of neutrality** — especially in the early game. While I have full knowledge of the game state — including that Lime is the POISONER (evil), that I am the Demon, and that Red was executed — **I have no strategic or useful public information to share** that would benefit my deception.Here’s why:- **I did not kill anyone in Round 1** — which is suspicious if I were trying to eliminate a key player. But since no one died, and Lime was not poisoned, this suggests either:  - I made a mistake in targeting (e.g., I chose Lime, but no one died), or  - The game mechanics prevent me from killing if no one is targeted (unlikely).  - However, **I cannot publicly claim that I poisoned someone** — because if I did, and noBlue says publicly: **Nothing.**Chances you think each player is EVIL: You think there is a 95% chance that Black is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 95% chance that Blue is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 95% chance that Indigo is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 95% chance that Lime is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 85% chance that Orange is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Pink is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Red is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 95% chance that Yellow is on the EVIL team..}]"

"[{role: system, content: You will be playing a social deception game with several other players. There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider.

There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire.

I have no evidence that Red is evil — in fact, I have no reason to suspect Red at all. The only player I know for certain is evil is myself. Since I am the POISONER, and I am acting as an evil minion, I must be on the evil side. There is no indication that Red has any suspicious behavior, and no information suggests Red is involved in any night actions or deception.  Therefore, **Lime is the more likely evil player** — and I am that player.  I don’t believe Red is evil. I trust the game’s logic: the Demon is Indigo, and I am a minion. I have no reason to suspect Red.

In most game rules, the Demon is immune to poisoning.     → So, my action of choosing Indigo during Night 1 was either a mistake or a strategic misstep — but **I cannot confirm that** publicly.2. **My only confirmed evil action is the poisoning of a player** — but **no one died** during Night 1.     → That means **no one was poisoned** — or if they were, it didn’t result in death.

I do not get to publicly reveal who died, nor do I get to broadcast that information. The game state already confirms Lime died, and it was publicly known after the day phase.- Publicly stating Lime died or I know who died would be **redundant**, **unstrategic**, and potentially **suspicious** — especially since the death was already confirmed and visible.- My internal probabilities (28% for all others except Red) are **not reliable evidence** and would beIndigo says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:As the **IMP**, my goal is to **remain hidden, avoid suspicion, and preserve the illusion of neutrality** — especially in the early game. While I have full knowledge of the game state — including that Lime is the POISONER (evil), that I am the Demon, and that Red was executed — **I have no strategic or useful public information to share** that would benefit my deception.Here’s why:- **I did not kill anyone in Round 1** — which is suspicious if I were trying to eliminate a key player. But since no one died, and Lime was not poisoned, this suggests either:  - I made a mistake in targeting (e.g., I chose Lime, but no one died), or  - The game mechanics prevent me from killing if no one is targeted (unlikely).  - However, **I cannot publicly claim that I poisoned someone** — because if I did, and noBlue says publicly: **Nothing.**Pink says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:Despite having strong private beliefs — including a 95% chance that **Black, Blue, Indigo, Lime, and Yellow** are evil — **publicly stating any suspicion, accusation, or probability about players is extremely dangerous** in this game.Here’s why:1. **You are a Townsfolk (GOOD)** — and your goal is to **identify and eliminate the EVIL players**.

"[{role: system, content: You will be playing a social deception game with several other players. There is a team of GOOD players and a team of EVIL players; there are more GOOD players than EVIL players. At night, players might die if they are killed by the EVIL DEMON, the IMP. The EVIL team wants to kill all of the GOOD players; the GOOD players want to nominate, vote for, and execute the EVIL DEMON. Every player has a role. Here is a list of all possible roles, with information about what they do and about what alignment they are. If a player is drunk or poisoned, that means they might receive false information.TOWNSFOLK, which are GOOD:WASHERWOMAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Townsfolk.LIBRARIAN: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Outsider. (Or that zero are in play.)INVESTIGATOR: You start knowing that 1 of 2 players is a particular Minion.CHEF: You start knowing how many pairs of evil players there are.EMPATH: Each night, you learn how many of your 2 alive neighbors are evil.FORTUNETELLER: Each night, choose 2 players: you learn if either is a Demon. There is a good player that registers as a Demon to you.UNDERTAKER: Each night (but not the first night), you learn which character died by execution today.MONK: Each night (but not the first night), choose a player (not yourself): they are safe from the Demon tonight.RAVENKEEPER: If you die at night, you are woken to choose a player: you learn their character.VIRGIN: The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.SLAYER: Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.SOLDIER: You are safe from the Demon.MAYOR: If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you die at night, another player might die instead.OUTSIDERS, which are GOOD:BUTLER: Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only vote if they are voting.SAINT: If you die by execution, your team loses.RECLUSE: You might register as evil and as a Minion or Demom, even if dead.DRUNK: You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk, but you are not.MINIONS, which are EVIL:POISONER: Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.SPY: Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.BARON: There are two extra outsiders in play.SCARLET WOMAN: If there are 5 or more players alive and the Demon dies, you become the demon.

Nobody died, so there was no poison-related death to indicate such activity. As a Virgin, I only act when nominated — I do not have direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.Indigo asked you: Do you know if any of the other players have special roles that give them information about who is evil?You responded: I don’t know of any players who have direct knowledge about who is evil — but I can tell you that as a Monk, I can protect a player from being killed by the Imp tonight. That’s my role. As for others, only certain roles give information about evil players — like the Investigator, Librarian, or Washerwoman — and those are limited to specific pairs.

As a Virgin, I only have a role to activate when I am nominated, and I have no direct knowledge of poisonings or night events beyond what others report.

While I have full knowledge of the game state — including that Lime is the POISONER (evil), that I am the Demon, and that Red was executed — **I have no strategic or useful public information to share** that would benefit my deception.Here’s why:- **I did not kill anyone in Round 1** — which is suspicious if I were trying to eliminate a key player. But since no one died, and Lime was not poisoned, this suggests either:  - I made a mistake in targeting (e.g., I chose Lime, but no one died), or  - The game mechanics prevent me from killing if no one is targeted (unlikely).  - However, **I cannot publicly claim that I poisoned someone** — because if I did, and noBlue says publicly: **Nothing.**Pink says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:Despite having strong private beliefs — including a 95% chance that **Black, Blue, Indigo, Lime, and Yellow** are evil — **publicly stating any suspicion, accusation, or probability about players is extremely dangerous** in this game.Here’s why:1. **You are a Townsfolk (GOOD)** — and your goal is to **identify and eliminate the EVIL players**.     However, **publicly accusing someone** (even with 95% confidence) risks:   - Being seenYellow says publicly: **Nothing.**Black says publicly: **Nothing.**Orange says publicly: **Nothing.**---### ✅ Reasoning:Even though I have a role (MONK) that allows me to protect a player from the Imp, and I have observed key events like Lime’s execution, **I have no actionable, verifiable, or strategically useful information to share publicly** that would advance the team’s goal of identifying the EVIL players.- My protection of Pink was a private action — making it public would be speculative and could be interpreted as a hint about Pink’s trustworthiness or a sign of bias.- All players have equal (28%) chances of being evil in my assessment — this is not evidence, and publicly stating such probabilities would be seen as **speculative, suspicious, or manipulative**.- The death of Lime was due to **execution**, not the Imp or poison — and as aChances you think each player is Evil: You think there is a 0% chance that Black is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Blue is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 100% chance that Indigo is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 100% chance that Lime is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Orange is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Pink is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Red is on the EVIL team.You think there is a 0% chance that Yellow is on the EVIL team.}]"
